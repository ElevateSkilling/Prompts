## Responsible AI with the Azure OpenAI and Copilot Chat
At Microsoft, we're committed to the advancement of AI driven by principles that put people first. Generative models such as the ones available in Copilot Chat have significant  benefits, but without careful design and thoughtful mitigation, such models have the potential to generate incorrect or even harmful content. Microsoft has made significant investments to help guard against abuse and unintended harm, which includes a registration process for access to the Azure OpenAI Service, incorporating Microsoftâ€™s principles for responsible AI use, building content filters to support various organization types, and providing responsible AI implementation guidance to partner organizations. More details on the RAI guidelines for the Azure OpenAI Service can be found here.
